# MunicipalDigitalization
A Software Engineering project for university for the digitalization of a municipal area.

This Project is developed following the Unified Process Model. The total number of Iteration of this project are 4 because the first one (Studying the fattibility of the project) isn't necessary.
As a common UP model Project, we defined a TimeStamp for each Iteration and some goals to follow.
The first One iteration was a 1 week Iteration, we analyzed the Actors of the Project and defined a total of 30 use cases and 20% of those were specified (Flow of events, analysis Mode and Project Model). We also created a first base version of the code.
The second Iteration was a 2 week Iteration. We decided that this iteration should be the longest one because is the most important in the project. In this Iteration we had to define and create an executable Baseline. We had to specified the 70/80% of the use cases
and we also had to add new ones. As required from the UP, we created the core code of the project.
